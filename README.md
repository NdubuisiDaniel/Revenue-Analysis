This Power BI project provides a comprehensive Sales Revenue Analysis for Company X, leveraging advanced data analytics techniques to drive strategic decision-making. 
The objective was to evaluate sales performance across multiple dimensions, including regions, products, customer segments, employee productivity, and marketing effectiveness. 
The project also aimed to identify growth opportunities, optimize profitability, and enhance overall business performance through data-driven insights.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to analyze and visualize key sales metrics to:
- Assess overall sales performance and identify revenue growth trends.
- Evaluate regional sales distribution and uncover underperforming markets.
- Examine product performance to optimize the product portfolio.
- Measure employee productivity and identify top performers.
- Analyze customer segments and retention rates to enhance loyalty programs.
- Investigate marketing campaign effectiveness and optimize marketing ROI.
- Provide actionable recommendations to support strategic business decisions.
Key Features and Highlights:
- Advanced Data Modeling and DAX Calculations:
- Created complex DAX Measures for accurate calculations, including Total Sales Revenue, Profit Margin, Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth, Quarterly Growth, Customer Retention, and Returning Customers.
- Implemented advanced Time Intelligence calculations to analyze trends over different time periods.
- Built dynamic Hierarchies (e.g., Date, Product, and Employee hierarchies) for drill-down analysis.
- Dynamic Row-Level Security (RLS):
- Applied Dynamic RLS using USERPRINCIPALNAME() and PATH() functions to restrict data visibility based on user roles.
- Enabled hierarchical data access, allowing managers to view their team’s performance while restricting individual contributors to their own data.
Comprehensive Visualizations and Interactive Dashboard Design:
- Designed interactive dashboards with a user-friendly interface for exploring sales data.
- Utilized a variety of visuals, including:
- Line Charts 
- Pie Charts
- Matrix Visuals 
- Card Visuals
- Treemap
